Strength and Conditioning Consultation (Online)

State of Fitness currently offering S&C coaching/consultation. This is for the motivated athlete with some training experience who takes ownership of their own training and basically just needs a coach to help point them in the right direction and guidance.

If you agree, we will first begin with an indepth consultation process in which we will discuss your goals and establish a plan of attack. We will then get to work on designing your training program and other (eg. nutrition etc) if needed.

You will require a phone as it will be your diary (both training and nutrition). Your training and nutrition plan will be sent to your phone. You will be required to download an app (available in Android and iOS). Your program is completely straight forward and contains detailed prescriptions recommendations for all aspects of the training you need. All exercises can be found in the app or there will be a link to show your how it is done. However if you prefer to work on a desktop, there are desktop options available.

Throughout the duration of your program you can rely upon unlimited consultation with your coach. You can use the app to send messages (similiar to SMS/Whatsapp) to your coach. For more detailed messages, you can email your coach and he will respond withnin 48 hours.

Who is this FOR:
Accountable and take ownership of self-training
Motivated AND Independent athletes
Some training experience
This is NOT FOR:
Personal Training
Expect to be spoonfed
Beginners*
Cost and Limitations:

How much does it cost? Trust us when we say it cost a training block (26 to 35 days) cost about the same as a single training session with a top personal trainer in Singapore (between S$100 to S$180).

There is also a very limited number of athletes that our coach will want to work with. He prioritise quality of coaching and actually takes prides in seeing the athlete he works with improves. Our coach has been known to work with athletes for free. He sincerly just enjoys coaching.

* Beginners – For most beginners, our coach would recommend actual practical hands on time with a strength and conditioning coach or at the very least a competent personal trainer. Contact us and we can provide you with some recommended strength and conditioning coaches and personal trainers.

The reason for this is because it is our belief that what a beginner would require the most is a sound knowledge and understanding of basic exercise technique. Trust me when we say that good technique is EVERYTHING. Remember an elite athlete will do the same exercise as the beginner. The only difference is that he does it more efficiently and with beautiful technique.
